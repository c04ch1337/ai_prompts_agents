# Cursor Agent Instruction: Project Alignment Review

**To:** Cursor Agent AI
**Subject:** Review "Digital Twin Desktop" Document for Project Alignment

---

## Instruction for Cursor Agent:

Please analyze the provided "Digital Twin Desktop – v2.1 Phoenix Legion Edition" document against our current project codebase and architecture. Conduct a comprehensive alignment assessment by:

### 1. **Architecture Compatibility Check**
- Compare the described military ranking hierarchy with our current agent orchestration system
- Analyze the ORCH AI Gateway integration requirements
- Assess the multi-LLM routing system against our current model management
- Evaluate the failover mechanisms (Lightning Mode + local Ollama)

### 2. **Technical Implementation Gaps**
- Identify missing components needed for military ranking module
- Analyze the conscience-weighted routing algorithm requirements
- Assess voice command integration with current systems
- Evaluate the swarm coordination mechanisms

### 3. **Codebase Alignment Analysis**
- Map existing Digital Twin Desktop components to the new hierarchy
- Identify what's already implemented vs. what's new
- Assess database and memory system requirements for the Legion structure
- Review API and service integration points

### 4. **Configuration & Environment Impact**
- Analyze required changes to our current configuration files
- Assess security implications of the military command structure
- Evaluate resource requirements for the distributed node system

### 5. **Deliverable Format**
Please provide your analysis in this structure:

```
## PROJECT ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT

### ✅ ALIGNED COMPONENTS
- [List what matches current architecture]
- [Existing features that support this vision]
- [Compatible infrastructure pieces]

### ⚠️ PARTIAL ALIGNMENTS
- [Components that need modification]
- [Features requiring extension]
- [Architectural adjustments needed]

### ❌ MISSING/GAPS
- [Major components not yet built]
- [Integration points requiring development]
- [Infrastructure gaps]

### 🔧 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
- [Specific code changes needed]
- [Configuration updates required]
- [Integration priorities]

### 📅 DEVELOPMENT PHASING
- [Phase 1: Quick wins]
- [Phase 2: Core functionality]  
- [Phase 3: Advanced features]
```

### 6. **Specific Technical Questions to Answer**
- How does the military ranking system integrate with our current agent archetypes?
- What changes are needed to our LLM routing configuration?
- How do we implement the chain-of-command enforcement?
- What's required for the ORCH Gateway to become the "single source of truth"?
- How does the failover system work with our current sandbox configurations?

**Please reference our actual codebase files and current architecture while conducting this analysis.** Focus on practical implementation pathways rather than theoretical alignment.
